# Customer Behavior Project-Data Analyst



## Project Discription:
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

1.Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

2.Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

3.Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis using Python
We began with data preparation and cleaning in Python:

● **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using pandas.

● **Initial Exploration:** Used df.info() to check structure and .describe() for summary statistics.

● **Missing Data Handling**: Checked for null values and imputed missing values in the Review Rating column using the median rating of each product category.

● **Column Standardization:** Renamed columns to snake case for better readability and documentation.

● **Feature Engineering:**

     ○ Created age_group column by binning customer ages.
     
     ○ Created purchase_frequency_days column from purchase data.
     
● **Data Consistency Check:** Verified if discount_applied and promo_code_used were redundant; dropped promo_code_used.

● **Database Integration:** Connected Python script to PostgreSQL and loaded the cleaned DataFrame into the database for SQL analysis.

## Data Analysis using SQL (Business Transactions):
We performed structured analysis in PostgreSQL to answer key business questions:

**1. Revenue by Gender** – Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers.

**2. High-Spending Discount Users** – Identified customers who used discounts but still spent above the average purchase amount.

**3. Top 5 Products by Rating** – Found products with the highest average review ratings.

**4. Shipping Type Comparison** – Compared average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping.

**5. Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers** – Compared average spend and total revenue across subscription status.

**6. Discount-Dependent Products** – Identified 5 products with the highest percentage of discounted purchases.

**7. Customer Segmentation** – Classified customers into New, Returning, and Loyal segments based on purchase history.

**8. Top 3 Products per Category** – Listed the most purchased products within each category.

**9. Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions** – Checked whether customers with >5 purchases are more likely to subscribe.

**10. Revenue by Age Group** – Calculated total revenue contribution of each age group.

## Dashboard in Power BI
Finally, we built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to present insights visually.

● **Review Discount Policy** – Balance sales boosts with margin control.

● **Product Positioning** – Highlight top-rated and best-selling products in campaigns.

● **Targeted Marketing** – Focus efforts on high-revenue age groups and express-shipping users.
